Responsive Number Generator

This is a new version of the Number-Generator, where you can input any number in the text box within reason of what your computer can manage without crashing the page. By clicking "Generate Numbers" the page will generate color coded numbers, showing green for even, yellow for odd, and red for prime.

I used HTML to lay the framework for the web page, JavaScript to design the responsive number generator and sorter, and CSS for the alignment of the page as well as th general styling of static elements.

The biggest challenges with this was learning how to make the input text register when hitting submit, and having that value sent to the number generator to set the paramater for how many numbers to generate.
